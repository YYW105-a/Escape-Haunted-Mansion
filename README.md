# Escape-Haunted-Mansion
This game immerses players in a haunted mansion made up of five interconnected escape rooms. Each room presents a distinct challenge (ranging from straightforward code-breaking to complex problem-solving) with difficulty ramping up as players advance. To progress, you must master every puzzle and unlock the door to the next chamber.

# Five Escape Rooms
- Room 1: A guessing game using a four-digit combination lock hidden on a dusty library book.
- Room 2: A number-sequence puzzle in the Portrait Hall, where trapped “time” must be released by identifying the next square in the series.
- Room 3: A riddle in the Ghostly Study, where only the correct word will appease the lingering spirit.
- Room 4: A cryptic math challenge in the Stone Chamber, combining exponentiation, square roots, and multiplication to reveal a golden key.
- Room 5: A final integration puzzle, requiring you to recall and speak the names of every freed soul in the order you rescued them, summoning the Soul of Freedom and opening the mansion’s front door.
